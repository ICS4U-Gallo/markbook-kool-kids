# Markbook Assignment
The goal is to review certain Python concepts as well as pick up some new ones along the way. The assignment will be done in scrum groups of approx. 5 people.

## Topics to be included
The program will include the following topics:
- Looping
- Lists
  - Insert and delete
- Dictionaries
- File read/write
- Functions
- Test suite using `Pytest`


## Setup
### Accept GitHub Classroom Assignment
Follow the github classroom link. One person creates a team, the other group members join the team.

### Clone your "fork"
GitHub Classroom will create a fork of my [original repository](https://github.com/ICS4U-Gallo/markbook-assignment).  Clone your fork (**ensure your fork URL has YOUR team name in the link**).

### Test it out
- Open your repository folder.
- In the terminal, run `Pytest` and ensure it says it ran two tests.

### Make some change
Have each person on the team make a change and push it to GitHub.


- Create a GitHub project board with the product backlog items in `product_backlog.md`.
